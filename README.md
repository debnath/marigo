# marigo

A Mario themed version of the 'Chrome Dino Game', written in Go, designed to work using the iTerm2 image hack. So, it will obviously only work in iTerm2.   Can be run with simply `go run main.go`, and then you press 's' to start, 'up arrow key' to jump, and 'esc' to quit!  

Note that the iTerm2 image hack is NOT designed to be used like this, even at a low resolution you'll only reliably get around 5 fps, while also using up a big amount of cpu capacity.  It's really just a curiousity project to work on when bored. :)

Currently incomplete....  all you can really do is jump and run over randomly scrolling objects. No collision detection or automatically generated levels (yet, possibly ever, depending on how bored / free I am).
