# marigo

A Mario themed version of the 'Chrome Dino Game', written in Go, designed to work using the Iterm2 image hack. So, it will obviously only work in Iterm2.   Can be run with simply `go run main.go`. 

Currently incomplete....  all you can really do is jump and run over randomly scrolling objects. No collision detection or automatically generated levels (yet, possibly ever, depending on how bored I get).
